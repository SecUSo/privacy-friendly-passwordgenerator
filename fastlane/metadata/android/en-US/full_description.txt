How does Privacy Friendly Password Generator differ from other similar apps?

1. No permissions
The Password Generator does not require any permissions.
For comparison: The Top Ten of similar apps from the Google Play Store requires an average of 3,4 permissions (in November 2016). These are for instance the location permission or the permissions to access, modify or delete storage.

2. Protection of passwords
The Password Generator does not store any generated password, nor does it store the master password. For the generation of password a stateless algorithm is used. This means that the passwords only exist during the generation and are not stored in the program after the application has been closed. Additionally, the app prevents devices from taking screenshots.

3. No advertisement
Moreover, the Password Generator distinguishes from many other applications in the way that it completely relinquishes advertisements. Advertisement might track a user's actions. It could also shorten battery life or use mobile data.
